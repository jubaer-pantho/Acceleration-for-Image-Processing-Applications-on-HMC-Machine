# Acceleration-of-Image-Processing-Library-Kernels-on-a-Hybrid-Memory-Cube-Computer

This work presents an HMC controller suitable for accelerating image processing application on an HMC enabled CPU

The system is built on a host processor with 4 Micron AC-510 board attached to it through PCIe connections. Each unit features a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale (XCVU060) FPGAs and an HMC memory 

Framework:
HMC_release_4.0
picocomputing 5.6.0.0




How to run:
1. Load the bitfile
2. Go to software directory
3. command: <./process 0>
