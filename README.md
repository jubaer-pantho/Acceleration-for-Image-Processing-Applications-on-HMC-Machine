# Acceleration-of-Image-Processing-Library-Kernels-on-a-Hybrid-Memory-Cube-Computer

This work presents an HMC controller suitable for accelerating image processing application on an HMC enabled CPU

The system is built on a host processor with 4 Micron AC-510 board attached to it through PCIe connections. Each unit features a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale (XCVU060) FPGAs and an HMC memory
