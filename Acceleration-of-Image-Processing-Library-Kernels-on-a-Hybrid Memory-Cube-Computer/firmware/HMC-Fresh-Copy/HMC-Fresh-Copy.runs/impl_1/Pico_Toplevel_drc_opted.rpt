PORTPROP-10#1 Advisory
Incorrect IOStandard on MCAP reset  
The PCI Express reset pin sys_reset_n is driven by an IOB with a 1.8V IO standard.  This is incompatible with the 3.3V signal that is generated by the reset pin of the PCI Express edge connector.  If this pin cannot be driven at 3.3V, your  design will require an external level shifter to convert the incoming 3.3V reset signal from the edge connector to the 1.8V at the FPGA pin.
